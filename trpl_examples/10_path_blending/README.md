# Example 10: Path_blending
Path blending makes the robot arm perform two moves in one continuous motion. To do this you use the `set_path_blending()` to enable or disable path blending in combination with `sync()` to force the execution of blended commands.

`set_path_blending(enable, blend_radius)` has two arguments:
* enable - Enable or disable path blending.
* blend_radius â€“ The blend radius between moves in meters.
