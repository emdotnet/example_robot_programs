# Example 8: sleep and pause
`sleep()` is a function that stops a program for a given amount of time. The sleep function takes in seconds as an argument for example `sleep(20)` will stop/pause the program for 20 seconds.

`pause()` is a function that pauses a program till you decide to resume the program by clicking the "CYCLE START" button in the system UI. The pause function has an "optional" argument that you can set to True/False to make a pause event optional, for example `pause(optional=True)` will make that pause event optional which means you can enable/activate that pause event by clicking "OPTIONAL PAUSE" in the system UI.
Optional pause events that are not activated will be skipped during the program run time.
