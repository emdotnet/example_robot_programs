# Example 7: drawing_a_circle_using_movec_and_pose_waypoints
This example show how to draw a circle using `movec()` and `Pose()/p[]`

[NOTE: Add video]

In the example we learn about:
* `movec()`: An arc/circular move command
* `movej()`: A joint move command. With this command, the robot end effector will move between points using the available efficient path, also considering angle limits for each joint.
* `Pose()`: This is used to create pose waypoints and its short form is p[].
